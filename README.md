# Pendulum Simulator

This project is a pendulum simulator that allows users to visualize and interact with a pendulum's motion in real-time. Built for the sake of a visual aid to a school project.

## Features

- Real-time pendulum motion visualization
- Interactive parameter controls:
  - Pendulum length
  - Mass
  - Starting angle
  - Gravity
  - Damping coefficient
  - Time interval
  - Simulation speed
- Play/Pause and Reset functionality
- Zoom controls for detailed observation
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Live Demo

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14
- **UI Components**: React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library**: Radix UI
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Animation**: Tailwind Animations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pendulum-simulator.git
cd pendulum-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Usage

1. **Basic Controls**:
   - Use the play/pause button to control the simulation
   - Click reset to return to initial conditions
   - Adjust zoom level using the zoom controls

2. **Parameter Adjustments**:
   - Modify the pendulum length to see how it affects the period
   - Change the mass to observe its impact on motion
   - Adjust gravity to simulate different environments
   - Use damping to simulate air resistance
   - Control simulation speed for detailed observation
